# Tauri + Astro + Svelte = TSA

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri using Astro, backed by Svelte.

## Getting Started

To get started:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `pnpm i`
3. Run `pnpm tauri dev`
4. Profit.

Thanks to JonasKruckenberg for the reference code. Originally I tried to run his template out of the box and kept receiving errors. Once it got working, I kept blowing the JS heap. Luckily Svelte makes everything better, and keeps the hot-reload functional as well!
